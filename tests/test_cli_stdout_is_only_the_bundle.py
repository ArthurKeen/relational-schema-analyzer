"""stdout carries the bundle and nothing else (reported by r2g).

``log.py`` defers to ``structlog`` when it is installed, and an **unconfigured**
structlog writes through ``PrintLogger`` to **stdout**, at debug level. So one
``logger.debug`` during a run landed in the middle of the JSON::

    $ relational-schema-analyzer analyze --source csv --url ./d --prior-run prev.json
    2026-10-26 12:03:51 [debug    ] bitemporal_fingerprint_unchanged carried_from=...
    {"conceptualSchema": ...

and the caller's ``json.load`` failed. ``--prior-run`` was implicated only because
it is the one flag whose path logs at debug.

Why it survived: **RSA never installs structlog.** It is in no extra, so CI always
took the stdlib fallback — which writes to *stderr* at *WARNING*, where both the
stream and the level hide it. The bug was only ever visible to an application that
brought structlog of its own, which is exactly what r2g does.

These tests therefore force the structlog path rather than trusting the ambient
environment, so the hole cannot reopen the same way.
