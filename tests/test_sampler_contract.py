"""The sampler contract every value sampler must satisfy (issue #10).

One clause carries this file: **sample the local column, test against the whole
referenced column.** Bounding the local side costs precision; bounding the referenced
side destroys the measurement, because a valid foreign key into a table larger than the
bound is then compared against an arbitrary slice of its parent.

Five samplers originally bounded both sides. Nothing caught it because the asymmetry was
stated in the README — prose implementers do not code against — and absent from the
``Sampler`` protocol, which they do. So the rule is asserted here, behaviourally, against
every sampler the module defines.

The registry test at the bottom is the part that survives contact with a sixth sampler:
adding a ``*ValueSampler`` class without registering it fails, even when its own case
skips for want of a database.
