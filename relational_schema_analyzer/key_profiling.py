"""Primary-key candidates from data, for sources that declare none.

FK inference targets only declared candidate keys, so a source that declares no
primary keys -- Snowflake by habit, lakes and warehouses by design -- yields no
relationships at all. This module proposes keys from the data. It never applies
them: the result is evidence for a person (or a draft key overlay) to review,
because a wrong identity key creates duplicate records that surface much later.

**Method.** For each table without a declared primary key:

1. *Screen on a sample.* One bounded query gives, per column, rows / non-null /
   distinct over the first ``probe.limit`` rows. A duplicate or a NULL in the
   sample is proof the column is not a key, so this rejection is sound.
2. *Confirm exactly.* Survivors are re-counted over the whole table -- unless the
   sample already covered every row. A candidate is never reported on sample
   evidence alone.
3. *Composite keys.* Only when no single column qualifies: pairs of
   identifier-like columns, bounded by ``max_pair_checks``. A search cut short
   by that bound, or by a declined probe, leaves the table in
   ``not_evaluated`` -- it is never reported as having no key.
4. *Rank.* Uniqueness alone does not make a key -- an email or a name can be
   unique today by accident. Candidates are scored on generic conventions
   (identifier-like names, a name derived from the table, type, position; a
   column named after *another* table counts against it, being the foreign-key
   convention) and every score carries the reasons behind it.

Queries go through a :class:`KeyProbe`, so cost governance is the probe's job;
:class:`~relational_schema_analyzer.fk_inference.SnowflakeValueSampler` is one,
with a query budget and statement timeout. A probe that declines (budget spent,
query failed) leaves the table in ``not_evaluated`` rather than guessed. Tables
that declare a primary key or a UNIQUE key are not profiled: FK inference
already treats a declared key as a candidate.
